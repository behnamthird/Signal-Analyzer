#  Signal Analyzer â€“ Python Mini Project

This is a simple Python project that simulates a time-series signal, processes it using a moving average filter, detects peaks, and visualizes the result.  
It is ideal for practicing basic Python skills including working with `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `scipy`.
